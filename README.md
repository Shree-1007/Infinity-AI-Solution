# **AI Chatbot**

## **Project Description**

The **AI Chatbot** is a conversational agent built using the Llama 2 transformer model and Pinecone for vector database storage. The chatbot is designed to answer questions and engage in conversations related to artificial intelligence, based on a large dataset of AI-related books. The chatbot is hosted using FastAPI and can be accessed via Ngrok.

## **Features**

- **Llama 2 Transformer:** Utilizes the powerful Llama 2 transformer model to generate human-like responses.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Pinecone is used to store and manage vector embeddings, ensuring fast and accurate retrieval of information.
- **Real-Time Conversations:** The chatbot provides real-time interactions, answering AI-related questions and engaging in discussions.
- **Hosted via FastAPI and Ngrok:** The chatbot is hosted on a local server using FastAPI, and Ngrok is used to expose the local server to the internet for public access.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Transformer Model:** Llama 2
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Hosting:** Ngrok

## **Usage**

1. **Start the chatbot server:**
   - Launch the FastAPI server locally using `uvicorn`.
   - Connect the Llama 2 model and Pinecone vector database.

2. **Chat with the bot:**
   - Once the server is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the provided interface or API endpoint.

3. **Explore AI topics:**
   - The chatbot is pre-trained on a collection of books related to artificial intelligence, allowing it to provide insights and answers to AI-related queries.
